We develop the basic theory of Octonions, including various identities
and properties of the octonions and of the octonionic product, a
description of 7D isometries and representations of orthogonal
transformations. To this end we first develop the theory of the vector
cross product in 7 dimensions. The development of the theory of
Octonions is inspired by that of the theory of Quaternions by Lawrence
Paulson. However, we do not work within the type class real_algebra_1
because the octonionic product is not associative.</description>

       <description>
This theory is inspired by the HOL Light development of quaternions,
but follows its own route. Quaternions are developed coinductively, as
in the existing formalisation of the complex numbers. Quaternions are
quickly shown to belong to the type classes of real normed division
algebras and real inner product spaces. And therefore they inherit a
great body of facts involving algebraic  laws, limits, continuity,
etc., which must be proved explicitly in the HOL Light version.  The
development concludes with the geometric interpretation of the product
of imaginary quaternions.</description>

       <description>
This entry is mainly about counting and approximating real roots (of a
polynomial) with multiplicity. We have first formalised the
Budan-Fourier theorem: given a polynomial with real coefficients, we
can calculate sign variations on Fourier sequences to over-approximate
the number of real roots (counting multiplicity) within an interval.
When all roots are known to be real, the over-approximation becomes
tight: we can utilise this theorem to count real roots exactly. It is
also worth noting that Descartes&#39; rule of sign is a direct
consequence of the Budan-Fourier theorem, and has been included in
this entry. In addition, we have extended previous formalised
Sturm&#39;s theorem to count real roots with multiplicity, while the
original Sturm&#39;s theorem only counts distinct real roots.
Compared to the Budan-Fourier theorem, our extended Sturm&#39;s
theorem always counts roots exactly but may suffer from greater
computational cost.</description>

       <description>
We present an Isabelle/HOL formalization and total correctness proof
for the incremental version of the Simplex algorithm which is used in
most state-of-the-art SMT solvers. It supports extraction of
satisfying assignments, extraction of unsatisfiable cores, incremental
assertion of constraints and backtracking. Formalization relies on
stepwise program refinement, starting from a simple specification,
going through a number of refinement steps, and ending up in a fully
executable functional implementation. Symmetries present in the
algorithm are handled with special care.</description>

&lt;p&gt; We formalize undecidablity results for Minsky machines. To
this end, we also formalize recursive inseparability.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We start by proving that Minsky machines can
compute arbitrary primitive recursive and recursive functions. We then
show that there is a deterministic Minsky machine with one argument
and two final states such that the set of inputs that are accepted in
one state is recursively inseparable from the set of inputs that are
accepted in the other state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a corollary, the
set of Minsky configurations that reach the first state but not the
second recursively inseparable from the set of Minsky configurations
that reach the second state but not the first. In particular both
these sets are undecidable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We do
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; prove that recursive functions can simulate
Minsky machines. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Utility functions form an essential part of game theory and economics.
In order to guarantee the existence of utility functions most of the
time sufficient properties are assumed in an axiomatic manner. One
famous and very common set of such assumptions is that of expected
utility theory. Here, the rationality, continuity, and independence of
preferences is assumed. The von-Neumann-Morgenstern Utility theorem
shows that these assumptions are necessary and sufficient for an
expected utility function to exists. This theorem was proven by
Neumann and Morgenstern in ``Theory of Games and Economic
Behavior&#39;&#39; which is regarded as one of the most influential
works in game theory. The formalization includes formal definitions of
the underlying concepts including continuity and independence of
preferences.</description>

&lt;p&gt; This article gives the basic theory of Pell&#39;s equation
&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 +
&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&amp;thinsp;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,
where
&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&amp;thinsp;&amp;isin;&amp;thinsp;&amp;#8469; is
a parameter and &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; are
integer variables. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The main result that is proven
is the following: If &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; is not a perfect square,
then there exists a &lt;em&gt;fundamental solution&lt;/em&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) that is not the
trivial solution (1, 0) and which generates all other solutions
(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;) in the sense that
there exists some
&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;thinsp;&amp;isin;&amp;thinsp;&amp;#8469;
such that |&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;| +
|&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;|&amp;thinsp;&amp;radic;&lt;span
style=&#34;text-decoration:
overline&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; =
(&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; +
&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;&amp;radic;&lt;span
style=&#34;text-decoration:
overline&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
This also implies that the set of solutions is infinite, and it gives
us an explicit and executable characterisation of all the solutions.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Based on this, simple executable algorithms for
computing the fundamental solution and the infinite sequence of all
non-negative solutions are also provided. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

We formalize the basics of projective geometry. In particular, we give
a proof of the so-called Hessenberg&#39;s theorem in projective plane
geometry. We also provide a proof of the so-called Desargues&#39;s
theorem based on an axiomatization of (higher) projective space
geometry using the notion of rank of a matroid. This last approach
allows to handle incidence relations in an homogeneous way dealing
only with points and without the need of talking explicitly about
lines, planes or any higher entity.</description>

a multiplicative subset (i.e. a submonoid of R seen as a

We follow Knuth (1971), Yao (1980) and Mehlhorn (1984).
The algorithms are memoized with the help of the AFP article

This entry contains a formalization of hidden Markov models [3] based
on Johannes Hölzl&#39;s formalization of discrete time Markov chains
[1]. The basic definitions are provided and the correctness of two
main (dynamic programming) algorithms for hidden Markov models is
proved: the forward algorithm for computing the likelihood of an
observed sequence, and the Viterbi algorithm for decoding the most
probable hidden state sequence. The Viterbi algorithm is made
executable including memoization.  Hidden markov models have various
applications in natural language processing. For an introduction see
Jurafsky and Martin [2].</description>

We present a formalization of probabilistic timed automata (PTA) for
which we try to follow the formula MDP + TA = PTA as far as possible:
our work starts from our existing formalizations of Markov decision
processes (MDP) and timed automata (TA) and combines them modularly.
We prove the fundamental result for probabilistic timed automata: the
region construction that is known from timed automata carries over to
the probabilistic setting. In particular, this allows us to prove that
minimum and maximum reachability probabilities can be computed via a
reduction to MDP model checking, including the case where one wants to
disregard unrealizable behavior. Further information can be found in
our ITP paper [2].</description>

We formalize with Isabelle/HOL a proof of a theorem by J. Hancl asserting the
irrationality of the sum of a series consisting of rational numbers, built up
by sequences that fulfill certain properties. Even though the criterion is a
number theoretic result, the proof makes use only of analytical arguments. We
also formalize a corollary of the theorem for a specific series fulfilling the
assumptions of the theorem.</description>

This document provides a concise overview on the core results of our
previous work on the exploration of axioms systems for category
theory. Extending the previous studies
(http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01493) we include one further axiomatic
theory in our experiments. This additional theory has been suggested
by Mac Lane in 1948. We show that the axioms proposed by Mac Lane are
equivalent to the ones we studied before, which includes an axioms set
suggested by Scott in the 1970s and another axioms set proposed by
Freyd and Scedrov in 1990, which we slightly modified to remedy a
minor technical issue.</description>

We present a lightweight framework for the automatic verified
(functional or imperative) memoization of recursive functions. Our
tool can turn a pure Isabelle/HOL function definition into a
monadified version in a state monad or the Imperative HOL heap monad,
and prove a correspondence theorem. We provide a variety of memory
implementations for the two types of monads. A number of simple
techniques allow us to achieve bottom-up computation and
space-efficient memoization. The framework’s utility is demonstrated
on a number of representative dynamic programming problems. A detailed
description of our work can be found in the accompanying paper [2].</description>

       <description>
We introduce OpSets, an executable framework for specifying and
reasoning about the semantics of replicated datatypes that provide
eventual consistency in a distributed system, and for mechanically
verifying algorithms that implement these datatypes. Our approach is
simple but expressive, allowing us to succinctly specify a variety of
abstract datatypes, including maps, sets, lists, text, graphs, trees,
and registers. Our datatypes are also composable, enabling the
construction of complex data structures. To demonstrate the utility of
OpSets for analysing replication algorithms, we highlight an important
correctness property for collaborative text editing that has
traditionally been overlooked; algorithms that do not satisfy this
property can exhibit awkward interleaving of text. We use OpSets to
specify this correctness property and prove that although one existing
replication algorithm satisfies this property, several other published
algorithms do not.</description>

       <description>
Bounded natural functors (BNFs) provide a modular framework for the
construction of (co)datatypes in higher-order logic.  Their functorial
operations, the mapper and relator, are restricted to a subset of the
parameters, namely those where recursion can take place.  For certain
applications, such as free theorems, data refinement, quotients, and
generalised rewriting, it is desirable that these operations do not
ignore the other parameters.  In this article, we formalise the
generalisation BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; that extends the mapper
and relator to covariant and contravariant parameters.  We show that
&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;s are closed under
functor composition and least and greatest fixpoints,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; subtypes inherit the BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; structure
under conditions that generalise those for the BNF case,
and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;s preserve
quotients under mild conditions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; These proofs
are carried out for abstract BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt;s similar to
the AFP entry BNF Operations.  In addition, we apply the
BNF&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; theory to several concrete functors.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This formalisation contains the proof that there is no
anonymous Social Choice Function for at least three agents and
alternatives that fulfils both Pareto-Efficiency and
Fishburn-Strategyproofness. It was derived from a proof of &lt;a
href=&#34;http://dss.in.tum.de/files/brandt-research/stratset.pdf&#34;&gt;Brandt
&lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which relies on an unverified
translation of a fixed finite instance of the original problem to SAT.
This Isabelle proof contains a machine-checked version of both the
statement for exactly three agents and alternatives and the lifting to
the general case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This theory provides a verified implementation of weight-balanced
trees following the work of &lt;a
href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796811000104&#34;&gt;Hirai
and Yamamoto&lt;/a&gt; who proved that all parameters in a certain
range are valid, i.e. guarantee that insertion and deletion preserve
weight-balance. Instead of a general theorem we provide parameterized
proofs of preservation of the invariant that work for many (all?)
valid parameters.</description>

CakeML is a functional programming language with a proven-correct
compiler and runtime system. This entry contains an unofficial version
of the CakeML semantics that has been exported from the Lem
specifications to Isabelle. Additionally, there are some hand-written
theory files that adapt the exported code to Isabelle and port proofs
from the HOL4 formalization, e.g. termination and equivalence proofs.</description>

       <title>A Theory of Architectural Design Patterns</title>

The following document formalizes and verifies several architectural
design patterns. Each pattern specification is formalized in terms of
a locale where the locale assumptions correspond to the assumptions
which a pattern poses on an architecture. Thus, pattern specifications
may build on top of each other by interpreting the corresponding
locale. A pattern is verified using the framework provided by the AFP
entry Dynamic Architectures. Currently, the document consists of
formalizations of 4 different patterns: the singleton, the publisher
subscriber, the blackboard pattern, and the blockchain pattern.
Thereby, the publisher component of the publisher subscriber pattern
is modeled as an instance of the singleton pattern and the blackboard
pattern is modeled as an instance of the publisher subscriber pattern.
In general, this entry provides the first steps towards an overall
theory of architectural design patterns.</description>

We study three different Hoare logics for reasoning about time bounds
of imperative programs and formalize them in Isabelle/HOL: a classical
Hoare like logic due to Nielson, a logic with potentials due to
Carbonneaux &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; and a &lt;i&gt;separation
logic&lt;/i&gt; following work by Atkey, Chaguérand and Pottier.
These logics are formally shown to be sound and complete. Verification
condition generators are developed and are shown sound and complete
too.  We also consider variants of the systems where we abstract from
multiplicative constants in the running time bounds, thus supporting a
big-O style of reasoning.  Finally we compare the expressive power of
the three systems.</description>

&lt;p&gt; A Treap is a binary tree whose nodes contain pairs
consisting of some payload and an associated priority. It must have
the search-tree property w.r.t. the payloads and the heap property
w.r.t. the priorities. Treaps are an interesting data structure that
is related to binary search trees (BSTs) in the following way: if one
forgets all the priorities of a treap, the resulting BST is exactly
the same as if one had inserted the elements into an empty BST in
order of ascending priority. This means that a treap behaves like a
BST where we can pretend the elements were inserted in a different
order from the one in which they were actually inserted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In particular, by choosing these priorities at random upon
insertion of an element, we can pretend that we inserted the elements
in &lt;em&gt;random order&lt;/em&gt;, so that the shape of the
resulting tree is that of a random BST no matter in what order we
insert the elements. This is the main result of this
formalisation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Short vectors in lattices and factors of integer polynomials are
related. Each factor of an integer polynomial belongs to a certain
lattice. When factoring polynomials, the condition that we are looking
for an irreducible polynomial means that we must look for a small
element in a lattice, which can be done by a basis reduction
algorithm. In this development we formalize this connection and
thereby one main application of the LLL basis reduction algorithm: an
algorithm to factor square-free integer polynomials which runs in
polynomial time. The work is based on our previous
Berlekamp–Zassenhaus development, where the exponential reconstruction
phase has been replaced by the polynomial-time basis reduction
algorithm. Thanks to this formalization we found a serious flaw in a
textbook.</description>

We formalize basic results on first-order terms, including matching and a
first-order unification algorithm, as well as well-foundedness of the
subsumption order. This entry is part of the &lt;i&gt;Isabelle
Formalization of Rewriting&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a
href=&#34;http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/isafor&#34;&gt;IsaFoR&lt;/a&gt;,
where first-order terms are omni-present: the unification algorithm is
used to certify several confluence and termination techniques, like
critical-pair computation and dependency graph approximations; and the
subsumption order is a crucial ingredient for completion.</description>
