       <description>
A geodesic metric space is Gromov hyperbolic if all its geodesic
triangles are thin, i.e., every side is contained in a fixed
thickening of the two other sides. While this definition looks
innocuous, it has proved extremely important and versatile in modern
geometry since its introduction by Gromov.  We formalize the basic
classical properties of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, notably the Morse
lemma asserting that quasigeodesics are close to geodesics, the
invariance of hyperbolicity under quasi-isometries, we define and
study the Gromov boundary and its associated distance, and prove that
a quasi-isometry between Gromov hyperbolic spaces extends to a
homeomorphism of the boundaries. We also prove a less classical
theorem, by Bonk and Schramm, asserting that a Gromov hyperbolic space
embeds isometrically in a geodesic Gromov-hyperbolic space. As the
original proof uses a transfinite sequence of Cauchy completions, this
is an interesting formalization exercise.  Along the way, we introduce
basic material on isometries, quasi-isometries, Lipschitz maps,
geodesic spaces, the Hausdorff distance, the Cauchy completion of a
metric space, and the exponential on extended real numbers.</description>

       <description>
We formalise a statement of Green’s theorem—the first formalisation to
our knowledge—in Isabelle/HOL. The theorem statement that we formalise
is enough for most applications, especially in physics and
engineering. Our formalisation is made possible by a novel proof that
avoids the ubiquitous line integral cancellation argument. This
eliminates the need to formalise orientations and region boundaries
explicitly with respect to the outwards-pointing normal vector.
Instead we appeal to a homological argument about equivalences between
paths.</description>

We present a formally verified implementation of multivariate Taylor
models. Taylor models are a form of rigorous polynomial approximation,
consisting of an approximation polynomial based on Taylor expansions,
combined with a rigorous bound on the approximation error. Taylor
models were introduced as a tool to mitigate the dependency problem of
interval arithmetic. Our implementation automatically computes Taylor
models for the class of elementary functions, expressed by composition
of arithmetic operations and basic functions like exp, sin, or square
root.</description>

       <description>
This entry shows that the falling factorial of a sum can be computed
with an expression using binomial coefficients and the falling
factorial of its summands. The entry provides three different proofs:
a combinatorial proof, an induction proof and an algebraic proof using
the Vandermonde identity.  The three formalizations try to follow
their informal presentations from a Mathematics Stack Exchange page as
close as possible. The induction and algebraic formalization end up to
be very close to their informal presentation, whereas the
combinatorial proof first requires the introduction of list
interleavings, and significant more detail than its informal
presentation.</description>

deterministically in linear time. The size bounds for the recursive

&lt;p&gt;This article provides a formalisation of Snyder’s simple and
elegant proof of the Mason&amp;ndash;Stothers theorem, which is the
polynomial analogue of the famous abc Conjecture for integers.
Remarkably, Snyder found this very elegant proof when he was still a
high-school student.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, the statement of the
theorem is that three non-zero coprime polynomials
&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;
over a field which sum to 0 and do not all have vanishing derivatives
fulfil max{deg(&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;), deg(&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;),
deg(&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;)} &lt; deg(rad(&lt;em&gt;ABC&lt;/em&gt;))
where the rad(&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;) denotes the
&lt;em&gt;radical&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;,
i.&amp;thinsp;e. the product of all unique irreducible factors of
&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This theorem also implies a
kind of polynomial analogue of Fermat’s Last Theorem for polynomials:
except for trivial cases,
&lt;em&gt;A&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; +
&lt;em&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; +
&lt;em&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; = 0 implies
n&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;2 for coprime polynomials
&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;
over a field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <description>
&lt;p&gt;This article provides a formalisation of Dirichlet characters
and Dirichlet &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;-functions including proofs of
their basic properties &amp;ndash; most notably their analyticity,
their areas of convergence, and their non-vanishing for &amp;Re;(s)
&amp;ge; 1. All of this is built in a very high-level style using
Dirichlet series. The proof of the non-vanishing follows a very short
and elegant proof by Newman, which we attempt to reproduce faithfully
in a similar level of abstraction in Isabelle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This
also leads to a relatively short proof of Dirichlet’s Theorem, which
states that, if &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; are
coprime, there are infinitely many primes &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; with
&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;equiv; &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; (mod
&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <description>
This entry formalizes the closure property of bounded natural functors
(BNFs) under seven operations. These operations and the corresponding
proofs constitute the core of Isabelle&#39;s (co)datatype package. To
be close to the implemented tactics, the proofs are deliberately
formulated as detailed apply scripts. The (co)datatypes together with
(co)induction principles and (co)recursors are byproducts of the
fixpoint operations LFP and GFP. Composition of BNFs is subdivided
into four simpler operations: Compose, Kill, Lift, and Permute. The
N2M operation provides mutual (co)induction principles and
(co)recursors for nested (co)datatypes.</description>

       <description>
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm is often used to show that the
problem of finding a string &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; in a text
&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; can be solved deterministically in
&lt;i&gt;O(|s| + |t|)&lt;/i&gt; time. We use the Isabelle
Refinement Framework to formulate and verify the algorithm. Via
refinement, we apply some optimisations and finally use the
&lt;em&gt;Sepref&lt;/em&gt; tool to obtain executable code in
&lt;em&gt;Imperative/HOL&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

Stochastic matrices are a convenient way to model discrete-time and
finite state Markov chains. The Perron&amp;ndash;Frobenius theorem
tells us something about the existence and uniqueness of non-negative
eigenvectors of a stochastic matrix.  In this entry, we formalize
stochastic matrices, link the formalization to the existing AFP-entry
on Markov chains, and apply the Perron&amp;ndash;Frobenius theorem to
prove that stationary distributions always exist, and they are unique
if the stochastic matrix is irreducible.</description>

We provide our Isabelle/HOL formalization of a Conflict-free
Replicated Datatype for Internet Message Access Protocol commands.
We show that Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) is guaranteed
by proving the commutativity of concurrent operations. We base our
formalization on the recently proposed &#34;framework for
establishing Strong Eventual Consistency for Conflict-free Replicated
Datatypes&#34; (AFP.CRDT) from Gomes et al. Hence, we provide an
additional example of how the recently proposed framework can be used
to design and prove CRDTs.</description>

We present a semantic embedding of a spatio-temporal multi-modal
logic, specifically defined to reason about motorway traffic, into
Isabelle/HOL. The semantic model is an abstraction of a motorway,
emphasising local spatial properties, and parameterised by the types
of sensors deployed in the vehicles. We use the logic to define
controller constraints to ensure safety, i.e., the absence of
collisions on the motorway. After proving safety with a restrictive
definition of sensors, we relax these assumptions and show how to
amend the controller constraints to still guarantee safety.</description>

We discuss a topological curiosity discovered by Kuratowski (1922):
the fact that the number of distinct operators on a topological space
generated by compositions of closure and complement never exceeds 14,
and is exactly 14 in the case of R. In addition, we prove a theorem
due to Chagrov (1982) that classifies topological spaces according to
the number of such operators they support.</description>

This entry provides a very abstract theory of transition systems that
can be instantiated to express various types of automata. A transition
system is typically instantiated by providing a set of initial states,
a predicate for enabled transitions, and a transition execution
function. From this, it defines the concepts of finite and infinite
paths as well as the set of reachable states, among other things. Many
useful theorems, from basic path manipulation rules to coinduction and
run construction rules, are proven in this abstract transition system
context. The library comes with instantiations for DFAs, NFAs, and
Büchi automata.</description>

&lt;li&gt;Definition of the complement automaton and proof that it

In complex analysis, the winding number measures the number of times a
path (counterclockwise) winds around a point, while the Cauchy index
can approximate how the path winds. This entry provides a
formalisation of the Cauchy index, which is then shown to be related
to the winding number. In addition, this entry also offers a tactic
that enables users to evaluate the winding number by calculating
Cauchy indices.</description>

We formalize the theory of homogeneous linear diophantine equations,
focusing on two main results: (1) an abstract characterization of
minimal complete sets of solutions, and (2) an algorithm computing
them. Both, the characterization and the algorithm are based on
previous work by Huet. Our starting point is a simple but inefficient
variant of Huet&#39;s lexicographic algorithm incorporating improved
bounds due to Clausen and Fortenbacher. We proceed by proving its
soundness and completeness. Finally, we employ code equations to
obtain a reasonably efficient implementation. Thus, we provide a
formally verified solver for homogeneous linear diophantine equations.</description>

       <description>
&lt;p&gt; This entry builds upon the results about formal and analytic
Dirichlet series to define the Hurwitz &amp;zeta; function and, based
on that, the Riemann &amp;zeta; function. This is done by first
defining them for &amp;real;(&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;) &gt; 1 and then
successively extending the domain to the left using the
Euler&amp;ndash;MacLaurin formula. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Some basic
results about these functions are also shown, such as their
analyticity on &amp;#8450;&amp;#8726;&amp;#123;1&amp;#125;, that they
have a simple pole with residue 1 at 1, their relation to the
&amp;Gamma; function, and the special values at negative integers and
positive even integers &amp;ndash; including the famous &amp;zeta;(-1)
= -1/12 and &amp;zeta;(2) = &amp;pi;&amp;sup2;/6. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
Lastly, the entry also contains Euler&#39;s analytic proof of the
infinitude of primes, based on the fact that
&amp;zeta;(&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;) has a pole at &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; =
1. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <description>
&lt;p&gt; Linear recurrences with constant coefficients are an
interesting class of recurrence equations that can be solved
explicitly. The most famous example are certainly the Fibonacci
numbers with the equation &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) =
&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-1) +
&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; - 2) and the quite
non-obvious closed form
(&lt;i&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
-
(-&lt;i&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)
/ &amp;radic;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration:
overline&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; where &amp;phi; is the golden ratio.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In this work, I build on existing tools in
Isabelle &amp;ndash; such as formal power series and polynomial
factorisation algorithms &amp;ndash; to develop a theory of these
recurrences and derive a fully executable solver for them that can be
exported to programming languages like Haskell. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Computers may help us to understand --not just verify-- philosophical
arguments. By utilizing modern proof assistants in an iterative
interpretive process, we can reconstruct and assess an argument by
fully formal means. Through the mechanization of a variant of St.
Anselm&#39;s ontological argument by E. J. Lowe, which is a
paradigmatic example of a natural-language argument with strong ties
to metaphysics and religion, we offer an ideal showcase for our
computer-assisted interpretive method.</description>

&lt;p&gt; We present an embedding of the second-order fragment of the
Theory of Abstract Objects as described in Edward Zalta&#39;s
upcoming work &lt;a
href=&#34;https://mally.stanford.edu/principia.pdf&#34;&gt;Principia
Logico-Metaphysica (PLM)&lt;/a&gt; in the automated reasoning
framework Isabelle/HOL. The Theory of Abstract Objects is a
metaphysical theory that reifies property patterns, as they for
example occur in the abstract reasoning of mathematics, as
&lt;b&gt;abstract objects&lt;/b&gt; and provides an axiomatic
framework that allows to reason about these objects. It thereby serves
as a fundamental metaphysical theory that can be used to axiomatize
and describe a wide range of philosophical objects, such as Platonic
forms or Leibniz&#39; concepts, and has the ambition to function as a
foundational theory of mathematics. The target theory of our embedding
as described in chapters 7-9 of PLM employs a modal relational type
theory as logical foundation for which a representation in functional
type theory is &lt;a
href=&#34;https://mally.stanford.edu/Papers/rtt.pdf&#34;&gt;known to
be challenging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nevertheless we arrive
at a functioning representation of the theory in the functional logic
of Isabelle/HOL based on a semantical representation of an Aczel-model
of the theory. Based on this representation we construct an
implementation of the deductive system of PLM which allows to
automatically and interactively find and verify theorems of PLM.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Our work thereby supports the concept of shallow
semantical embeddings of logical systems in HOL as a universal tool
for logical reasoning &lt;a
href=&#34;http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/inf/groups/ag-ki/publications/Universal-Reasoning/1703_09620_pd.pdf&#34;&gt;as
promoted by Christoph Benzm&amp;uuml;ller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The most notable result of the presented work is the
discovery of a previously unknown paradox in the formulation of the
Theory of Abstract Objects. The embedding of the theory in
Isabelle/HOL played a vital part in this discovery. Furthermore it was
possible to immediately offer several options to modify the theory to
guarantee its consistency. Thereby our work could provide a
significant contribution to the development of a proper grounding for
object theory. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Economic activity has always been a fundamental part of society. Due
to modern day politics, economic theory has gained even more influence
on our lives. Thus we want models and theories to be as precise as
possible. This can be achieved using certification with the help of
formal proof technology. Hence we will use Isabelle/HOL to construct
two economic models, that of the the pure exchange economy and a
version of the Arrow-Debreu Model. We will prove that the
&lt;i&gt;First Theorem of Welfare Economics&lt;/i&gt; holds within
both. The theorem is the mathematical formulation of Adam Smith&#39;s
famous &lt;i&gt;invisible hand&lt;/i&gt; and states that a group of
self-interested and rational actors will eventually achieve an
efficient allocation of goods and services.</description>

Andersson introduced &lt;em&gt;general balanced trees&lt;/em&gt;,
search trees based on the design principle of partial rebuilding:
perform update operations naively until the tree becomes too
unbalanced, at which point a whole subtree is rebalanced.  This article
defines and analyzes a functional version of general balanced trees,
which we call &lt;em&gt;root-balanced trees&lt;/em&gt;. Using a lightweight model
of execution time, amortized logarithmic complexity is verified in
the theorem prover Isabelle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the Isabelle formalization of the material decribed in the APLAS 2017 article
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/aplas17.html&#34;&gt;Verified Root-Balanced Trees&lt;/a&gt;
by the same author, which also presents experimental results that show
competitiveness of root-balanced with AVL and red-black trees.

The Orbit-Stabiliser theorem is a basic result in the algebra of
groups that factors the order of a group into the sizes of its orbits
and stabilisers.  We formalize the notion of a group action and the
related concepts of orbits and stabilisers. This allows us to prove
the orbit-stabiliser theorem.  In the second part of this work, we
formalize the tetrahedral group and use the orbit-stabiliser theorem
to prove that there are twelve (orientation-preserving) rotations of
the tetrahedron.</description>

The propositions-as-types correspondence is ordinarily presented as
linking the metatheory of typed λ-calculi and the proof theory of
intuitionistic logic. Griffin observed that this correspondence could
be extended to classical logic through the use of control operators.
This observation set off a flurry of further research, leading to the
development of Parigots λμ-calculus. In this work, we formalise λμ-
calculus in Isabelle/HOL and prove several metatheoretical properties
such as type preservation and progress.</description>

This entry formalizes the two geometric theorems, Stewart&#39;s and
Apollonius&#39; theorem. Stewart&#39;s Theorem relates the length of
a triangle&#39;s cevian to the lengths of the triangle&#39;s two
sides. Apollonius&#39; Theorem is a specialisation of Stewart&#39;s
theorem, restricting the cevian to be the median. The proof applies
the law of cosines, some basic geometric facts about triangles and
then simply transforms the terms algebraically to yield the
conjectured relation. The formalization in Isabelle can closely follow
the informal proofs described in the Wikipedia articles of those two
theorems.</description>

       <description>
The architecture of a system describes the system&#39;s overall
organization into components and connections between those components.
With the emergence of mobile computing, dynamic architectures have
become increasingly important. In such architectures, components may
appear or disappear, and connections may change over time. In the
following we mechanize a theory of dynamic architectures and verify
the soundness of a corresponding calculus. Therefore, we first
formalize the notion of configuration traces as a model for dynamic
architectures. Then, the behavior of single components is formalized
in terms of behavior traces and an operator is introduced and studied
to extract the behavior of a single component out of a given
configuration trace. Then, behavior trace assertions are introduced as
a temporal specification technique to specify behavior of components.
Reasoning about component behavior in a dynamic context is formalized
in terms of a calculus for dynamic architectures. Finally, the
soundness of the calculus is verified by introducing an alternative
interpretation for behavior trace assertions over configuration traces
and proving the rules of the calculus. Since projection may lead to
finite as well as infinite behavior traces, they are formalized in
terms of coinductive lists. Thus, our theory is based on
Lochbihler&#39;s formalization of coinductive lists. The theory may
be applied to verify properties for dynamic architectures.</description>
