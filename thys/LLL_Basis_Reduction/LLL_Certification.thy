section \<open>Certification of External LLL Invocations\<close>

text \<open>Instead of using a fully verified algorithm, we also provide a technique to invoke
an external LLL solver. In order to check its result, we not only need the reduced basic,
but also the matrices which translate between the input basis and the reduced basis. 
Then we can easily check whether the resulting lattices are indeed identical and just have
to start the verified algorithm on the already reduced basis.
This invocation will then usually just require one computation of Gram--Schmidt in order
to check that the basis is already reduced. Alternatively, one could also through an error
message in case the basis is not reduced.\<close>

text \<open>This is the key lemma. It permits to change from the initial basis
@{term fs_init} to an arbitrary @{term gs} that has been computed by some
external tool. Here, two change-of-basis matrices U1 and U2 are required 
to certify the change via the conditions prod1 and prod2.\<close>

lemma LLL_change_basis: assumes gs: "set gs \<subseteq> carrier_vec n" 
  and len': "length gs = m" 
  and U1: "U1 \<in> carrier_mat m m" 
  and U2: "U2 \<in> carrier_mat m m" 
  and prod1: "mat_of_rows n fs_init = U1 * mat_of_rows n gs" 
  and prod2: "mat_of_rows n gs = U2 * mat_of_rows n fs_init" 
shows "lattice_of gs = lattice_of fs_init" "LLL_with_assms n m gs \<alpha>" 
proof -
  let ?i = "of_int :: int \<Rightarrow> int" 
  have "U1 = map_mat ?i U1" by (intro eq_matI, auto)
  with prod1 have prod1: "mat_of_rows n fs_init = map_mat ?i U1 * mat_of_rows n gs" by simp

  moreover have "lattice_of gs \<supseteq> lattice_of fs_init"
