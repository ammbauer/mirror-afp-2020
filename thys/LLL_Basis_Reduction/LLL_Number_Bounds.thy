subsection \<open>Explicit Bounds for Size of Numbers that Occur During LLL Algorithm\<close>

text \<open>The LLL invariant does not contain bounds on the number that occur during the execution. 
  We here strengthen the invariant so that it enforces bounds on the norms of the $f_i$ and $g_i$
  and we prove that the stronger invariant is maintained throughout the execution of the LLL algorithm.

  Based on the stronger invariant we prove bounds on the absolute values of the $\mu_{i,j}$,
  and on the absolute values of the numbers in the vectors $f_i$ and $g_i$. 
  Moreover, we further show that also the denominators in all of these numbers doesn't grow to much.
  Finally, we prove that each number (i.e., numerator or denominator) during the execution 
  can be represented with at most ${\cal OO}(m \cdot \log(M \cdot n))$ bits, where
  $m$ is the number of input vectors, $n$ is the dimension of the input vectors,
  and $M$ is the maximum absolute value of all numbers in the input vectors.
  Hence, each arithmetic operation in the LLL algorithm can be performed in polynomial time.\<close>
