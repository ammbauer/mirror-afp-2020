text \<open>We have a lot of (large) inequalities to prove. It is very convenient to have a set of
introduction rules for this purpose (a lot should be added to it, I have put here all the ones
I needed).

The typical use case is when one wants to prove some inequality, say
$ \exp (x*x) \leq y + \exp(1 + z * z + y)$, assuming $y \geq 0$ and $0 \leq x \leq z$.
One would write it has
\begin{verbatim}
have "0 + \exp(0 + x * x + 0) < = y + \exp(1 + z * z + y)"
using `y > = 0` `x < = z` by (intro mono_intros)
\end{verbatim}
When the left and right hand terms are written in completely analogous ways as above, then the
introduction rules (that contain monotonicity of addition, of the exponential, and so on) reduce
this to comparison of elementary terms in the formula. This is a very naive strategy, that fails
in many situations, but that is very efficient when used correctly.

not require the same strength of assumptions.

One of the implications is the following characterization of continuity using sequences.\<close>

text \<open>In situations of interest to us later on, convergence is well controlled only for sequences
living in some dense subset of the space (but the limit can be anywhere). This is enough to
establish continuity of the function, if the target space is well enough separated.

The statement we give below is very general,
as we do not assume that the function is continuous inside the original set $S$, it will typically
only be continuous at a set $T$ contained in the closure of $S$. In many applications, $T$ will
be the closure of $S$, but we are also thinking of the case where one constructs an extension
of a function inside a space, to its boundary, and the behaviour at the boundary is better than
inside the space. The example we have in mind is the extension of a quasi-isometry to the boundary
of a Gromov hyperbolic space.

In the following criterion, we assume that if $u_n$ inside $S$ converges to a point at the boundary
$T$, then $f(u_n)$ converges (where $f$ is some function inside). Then, we can extend the function $f$ at
the boundary, by picking the limit value of $f(u_n)$ for some sequence converging to $u_n$. Then
the lemma asserts that $f$ is continuous at every point $b$ on the boundary.

The proof is done in two steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, if $v_n$ is another inside sequence tending to
the same point $b$ on the boundary, then $f(v_n)$ converges to the same value as $f(u_n)$: this is
proved by considering the sequence $w$ equal to $u$ at even times and to $v$ at odd times, and
saying that $f(w_n)$ converges. Its limit is equal to the limit of $f(u_n)$ and of $f(v_n)$, so they
have to coincide.
\item Now, consider a general sequence $v$ (in the space or the boundary) converging to $b$. We want
to show that $f(v_n)$ tends to $f(b)$. If $v_n$ is inside $S$, we have already done it in the first
step. If it is on the boundary, on the other hand, we can approximate it by an inside point $w_n$
for which $f(w_n)$ is very close to $f(v_n)$. Then $w_n$ is an inside sequence converging to $b$,
hence $f(w_n)$ converges to $f(b)$ by the first step, and then $f(v_n)$ also converges to $f(b)$.
The precise argument is more conveniently written by contradiction. It requires good separation
properties of the target space.

text \<open>Then, we prove the continuity criterion for extensions of functions to the boundary $T$ of a set
$S$. The first assumption is that $f(u_n)$ converges when $f$ converges to the boundary, and the
second one that the extension of $f$ to the boundary has been defined using the limit along some
sequence tending to the point under consideration. The following criterion is the most general one,
but this is not the version that is most commonly applied so we use a prime in its name.\<close>

also prove useful to construct sets of integer numbers.
