subsection \<open>Definition, basic properties\<close>

text \<open>Although we will mainly work with type classes later on, we introduce the definition
of hyperbolicity on subsets of a metric space.

A set is $\delta$-hyperbolic if it satisfies the following inequality. It is very obscure at first sight,
but we will see several equivalent characterizations later on. For instance, a space is hyperbolic
(maybe for a different constant $\delta$) if all geodesic triangles are thin, i.e., every side is
close to the union of the two other sides. This definition captures the main features of negative
curvature at a large scale, and has proved extremely fruitful and influential.

Two important references on this topic are~\cite{ghys_hyperbolique} and~\cite{bridson_haefliger}.
We will sometimes follow them, sometimes depart from them.\<close>

text \<open>A good formulation of hyperbolicity is in terms of Gromov products. Intuitively, the
Gromov product of $x$ and $y$ based at $e$ is the distance between $e$ and the geodesic between
$x$ and $y$. It is also the time after which the geodesics from $e$ to $x$ and from $e$ to $y$

text \<open>The basic result we will use twice below is the following: if points on sides of triangles

space is hyperbolic. The proof goes as follows. One wants to show that $(x,z)_e \geq
\min((x,y)_e, (y,z)_e) - \delta = t-\delta$. On $[ex]$, $[ey]$ and $[ez]$, consider points
$wx$, $wy$ and $wz$ at distance $t$ of $e$. Then $wx$ and $wy$ are $\delta$-close by assumption,
and so are $wy$ and $wz$. Then $wx$ and $wz$ are $2\delta$-close. One can use these two points

text \<open>We prove that if triangles are thin, i.e., they satisfy the Rips condition, i.e., every side
of a triangle is included in the $\delta$-neighborhood of the union of the other triangles, then
the space is hyperbolic. If a point $w$ on $[xy]$ satisfies $d(x,w) < (y,z)_x - \delta$, then its
friend on $[xz] \cup [yz]$ has to be on $[xz]$, and roughly at the same distance of the origin.
Then it follows that the point on $[xz]$ with $d(x,w') = d(x,w)$ is close to $w$, as desired.
If $d(x,w) \in [(y,z)_x - \delta, (y,z)_x)$, we argue in the same way but for the point which
is closer to $x$ by an amount $\delta$. Finally, the last case $d(x,w) = (y,z)_x$ follows by
continuity.\<close>

text \<open>Then, we prove that if triangles are slim (i.e., there is a point that is $\delta$-close to
all sides), then the space is hyperbolic. Using the previous statement, we should show that points
on $[xy]$ and $[xz]$ at the same distance $t$ of the origin are close, if $t \leq (y,z)_x$.
There are two steps:
- for $t = (y,z)_x$, then the two points are in fact close to the middle of the triangle
(as this point satisfies $d(x,y) = d(x,w) + d(w,y) + O(\delta)$, and similarly for the other sides,
one gets readily $d(x,w) = (y,z)_w + O(\delta)$ by expanding the formula for the Gromov product).
Hence, they are close together.
- For $t < (y,z)_x$, we argue that there are points $y' \in [xy]$ and $z' \in [xz]$ for which
$t = (y',z')_x$, by a continuity argument and the intermediate value theorem.
Then the result follows from the first step in the triangle $xy'z'$.

The proof we give is simpler than the one in~\cite{ghys_hyperbolique}, and gives better constants.\<close>

    text \<open>We show that $d(x, wxy)$ is close to the Gromov product of $y$ and $z$ seen from $x$.
    This follows from the fact that $w$ is essentially on all geodesics, so that everything simplifies
    when one writes down the Gromov products, leaving only $d(x, w)$ up to $O(\delta)$.
    To get the right $O(\delta)$, one has to be a little bit careful, using the triangular inequality

subsection \<open>Morse Lemma\<close>

text \<open>A central feature of hyperbolic spaces is that a path from $x$ to $y$ can not deviate
too much from a geodesic from $x$ to $y$ unless it is extremely long (exponentially long in
terms of the distance from $x$ to $y$). This is useful both to ensure that short paths (for instance
quasi-geodesics) stay close to geodesics, see the Morse lemme below, and to ensure that paths
that avoid a given large ball of radius $R$ have to be exponentially long in terms of $R$ (this
is extremely useful for random walks). This proposition is the first non-trivial result
on hyperbolic spaces in~\cite{bridson_haefliger} (Proposition III.H.1.6). We follow their proof.

The proof is geometric, and uses the existence of geodesics and the fact that geodesic
triangles are thin. In fact, the result still holds if the space is not geodesic, as
it can be deduced by embedding the hyperbolic space in a geodesic hyperbolic space and using
the result there.\<close>

text \<open>The next theorem is often called simply the Morse Lemma, but it is really
a theorem, and we add the name Gromov the avoid the confusion with the other Morse lemma
on the existence of good coordinates for $C^2$ functions with non-vanishing hessian.

It states that a quasi-geodesic remains within bounded distance of a geodesic with the same
endpoints, the error depending only on $\delta$ and on the parameters $(\lambda, C)$ of the
quasi-geodesic, but not on its length.

Contrary to usual practice, we try to get an explicit constant for the upper bound,
although we do not try to get something particularly good. What the proof really
gives is a bound of the form $K \lambda^2 (C + \delta \ln (\lambda (1+C)))$ for some explicit
constant $K$. However, for convenience of use, we bound this from above by
$K'\lambda^2 (C+\lambda+\delta^2)$ for some $K'$ -- we get $K'=81$.

We follow the proof in~\cite{bridson_haefliger}.\<close>

    text \<open>We show that the distance of any point in the geodesic from $c(A)$ to $c(B)$ is a bounded
    distance away from the quasi-geodesic $d$, by considering a point $x$ where the distance $D$ is
    maximal and arguing around this point.

    Consider the point $x_m$ on the geodesic $[c(A), c(B)]$ at distance $2D$ from $x$, and the closest
    point $y_m$ on the image of $d$. Then the distance between $x_m$ and $y_m$ is at most $D$. Hence
    a point on $[x_m,y_m]$ is at distance at least $2D - D = D$ of $x$. In the same way, define $x_M$
    and $y_M$ on the other side of $x$. Then the excursion from $x_m$ to $y_m$, then to $y_M$ along
    $d$, then to $x_M$, has length at most $D + (\lambda \cdot 6D + C) + D$ and is always at distance
    at least $D$ from $x$. It follows from the previous lemma that $D \leq \log(length)$, which
    implies a bound on $D$.

    This argument has to be amended if $x$ is at distance $<2D$ from $c(A)$ or $c(B)$. In this case,
    simply use $x_m = y_m = c(A)$ or $x_M = y_M = c(B)$, then everything goes through.\<close>

    text \<open>This is the end of the first step, i.e., showing that $[c(A), c(B)]$ is included in
    the neighborhood of size $D0$ of the quasi-geodesic.\<close>

    text \<open>Now, we start the second step: we show that the quasi-geodesic is included in the
    neighborhood of size $D1$ of the geodesic, where $D1 \geq D0$ is the constant defined below.
    The argument goes as follows. Assume that a point $y$ on the quasi-geodesic is at distance $>D0$
    of the geodesic. Consider the last point $y_m$ before $y$ which is at distance $D0$ of the
    geodesic, and the first point $y_M$ after $y$ likewise. On $(y_m, y_M)$, one is always at distance
    $>D0$ of the geodesic. However, by the first step, the geodesic is covered by the balls of radius
    $D0$ centered at points on the quasi-geodesic -- and only the points before $y_m$ or after $y_M$
    can be used. Let $K_m$ be the points on the geodesics that are at distance $\leq D0$ of a point
    on the quasi-geodesic before $y_m$, and likewise define $K_M$. These are two closed subsets of
    the geodesic. By connectedness, they have to intersect. This implies that some points before $y_m$
    and after $y_M$ are at distance at most $2D0$. Since we are dealing with a quasi-geodesic, this
    gives a bound on the distance between $y_m$ and $y_M$, and therefore a bound between $y$ and the
    geodesic, as desired.\<close>

text \<open>We deduce that hyperbolicity is invariant under quasi-isometry. The proof goes as follows:
we want to see that a geodesic triangle is delta-thin, i.e., a point on a side $Gxy$ is close to the
union of the two other sides $Gxz$ and $Gyz$. Pull everything back by the quasi-isometry: we obtain
three quasi-geodesic, each of which is close to the corresponding geodesic segment by the Morse lemma.
As the geodesic triangle is thin, it follows that the quasi-geodesic triangle is also thin, i.e.,
a point on $f^{-1}Gxy$ is close to $f^{-1}Gxz \cup f^{-1}Gyz$ (for some explicit, albeit large,
constant). Then push everything forward by $f$: as it is a quasi-isometry, it will again distort
distances by a bounded amount.\<close>

text \<open>We can now prove that a metric tree is Gromov hyperbolic, for $\delta = 0$. The simplest
proof goes through the slim triangles property: it suffices to show that, given a geodesic triangle,
there is a point at distance at most $0$ of each of its sides. This is the center we have
constructed above.\<close>

class metric_tree_with_delta = metric_tree + metric_space_with_deltaG +

  assumes delta0: "deltaG(TYPE('a::metric_space)) = 0"

class Gromov_hyperbolic_space_0_geodesic = Gromov_hyperbolic_space_0 + geodesic_space

text \<open>Isabelle does not accept cycles in the class graph. So, we will show that
\verb+metric_tree_with_delta+ is a subclass of \verb+Gromov_hyperbolic_0_geodesic+, and
conversely that \verb+Gromov_hyperbolic_space_0_geodesic+ is a subclass of \verb+metric_tree+.

In a tree, we have already proved that triangles are $0$-slim (the center is common to all sides
of the triangle). The $0$-hyperbolicity follows from one of the equivalent characterizations
of hyperbolicity (the other characterizations could be used as well, but the proofs would be
less immediate.)\<close>

text \<open>Let us now prove the converse: a geodesic space which is $\delta$-hyperbolic for $\delta = 0$
is a metric tree. For the proof, we consider two geodesic segments $G = [x,y]$ and $H = [y,z]$ with a common
endpoint, and we have to show that their union is still a geodesic segment from $x$ to $z$. For
this, introduce a geodesic segment $L = [x,z]$. By the property of thin triangles, $G$ is included
in $H \cup L$. In particular, a point $Y$ close to $y$ but different from $y$ on $G$ is on $L$,
and therefore realizes the equality $d(x,z) = d(x, Y) + d(Y, z)$. Passing to the limit, $y$
also satisfies this equality. The conclusion readily follows thanks to Lemma
\verb+geodesic_segment_union+.
