\begin{abstract}
We formalized three algorithms for polynomial interpolation over arbitrary fields: 
Kronecker's explicit expression,
the recursive algorithm of Neville and Aitken,
and the Newton interpolation in combination with an efficient implementation of divided differences.
Variants of these algorithms for integer polynomials are also available,
where sometimes the interpolation can fail; e.g., there is no
linear integer polynomial $p$ such that $p(0) = 0$ and $p(2) = 1$. Moreover, for
the Newton interpolation for integer polynomials, we proved that all intermediate 
results that are computed during the algorithm must be integers.
This admits an early failure detection in the implementation, and theoretically implies that
there is no integer polynomial $p$ satisfying $p(0) = 0$ and $p(2) = 1$, regardless
of the degree of the polynomial.
Finally, we proved the uniqueness of polynomial interpolation.

The development also contains improved code equations to speed up the division of integers
in target languages.

\section{Introduction}

All of the algorithms have been taken from Wikipedia.
TODO: find some algebra book where all of the algorithms are described and \cite{it}.

TODO: write some more text, also included side-products, like improved code equations for
division.
