subsection \<open>Finding a Suitable Prime\<close>

text \<open>The Berlekamp-Zassenhaus algorithm demands for an input polynomial $f$ to determine
  a prime $p$ such that $f$ is square-free mod $p$ and such that $p$ and the leading coefficient
  of $f$ are coprime. To this end, we first prove that such a prime always exists, provided that 
  $f$ is square-free over the integers. Second, we provide a generic algorithm which searches for 
  primes have a certain property $P$. Combining both results gives us the suitable prime for
  the Berlekamp-Zassenhaus algorithm.\<close>
