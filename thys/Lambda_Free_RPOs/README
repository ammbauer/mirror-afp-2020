The ".thy" files are Isabelle theory files. They can be processed using a
recent development version of Isabelle (d4b89572ae71) as follows:

    isabelle jedit Lambda_Free_RPOs.thy

The main files are

    Lambda_Free_RPO_New.thy
    Lambda_Free_RPO_Optim.thy

A PDF version of the proof is available as
