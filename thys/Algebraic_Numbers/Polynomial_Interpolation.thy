section \<open>Polynomial Interpolation\<close>

text \<open>We combine the Newton interpolation and the Lagrange interpolation to a combined
  interpolation algorithm which is parametric. This parametric algorithm is then
  further extend from fields to also perform interpolation of integer polynomials.\<close>
