section \<open>Complex Algebraic Numbers\<close>

text \<open>Since currently there is no immediate analog of Sturm's theorem for the complex numbers,
  we implement complex algebraic numbers via their real and imaginary part.
  
  The major algorithm in this theory is a factorization algorithm which factors a rational
  polynomial over the complex numbers. 

  This algorithm is then combined with explicit root algorithms to try to factor arbitrary  
  complex polymials.\<close>
