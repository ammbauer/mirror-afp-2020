section \<open>Algebraic Numbers: Addition and Multiplication\<close>

text \<open>This theory contains the remaining field operations for algebraic numbers, namely
  addition and multiplication. In contrast to the previous development which have been
  generic, here we have specific results for complex and real algebraic numbers. The main
  reason is that we only proved that the resultant will be non-zero for complex and real
  numbers.\<close>
