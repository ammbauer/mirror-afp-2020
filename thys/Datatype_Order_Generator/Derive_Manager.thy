The derive manager allows to install various deriving-commands, e.g., to derive 
orders, pretty-printer, hash-functions, \ldots. -functions. All of the registered commands
are then accessible via the \texttt{derive}-command, e.g., \texttt{derive hashable list}
would automatically derive a hash-function for the datatype \texttt{list}.

There is also the diagnostic command \texttt{print-derives} which shows a list of options
what can currently be derived.
