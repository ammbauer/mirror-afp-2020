section \<open>Division of Polynomials over Integral Domains\<close>

text \<open>This theory contains two algorithms to compute (pseudo) polynomial long division
  of polynomials over integral domains. The one for pseudo division of $f$ and $g$ computes 
  a quotient and remainder such that $cf = qg + r$ for a suitable constant $c$. The latter
  one implements standard polynomial long division where it is guaranteed that division of
  $fg$ by $g$ yields $f$.\<close>

text \<open>A following type class is similar to @{class idom_divide}, but it has its own division operator.
  This is necessary for nesting, since the existing division on polynomials is only defined if the coefficients
  are taken from a field. In contrast, the upcoming algorithms allow nesting of polynomials, e.g., to perform
  division of polynomials over polynomials over polynomials over integer numbers.\<close>
