section \<open>Implementation and soundness of a modified version of Algorithm 16.22\<close>

text \<open>Algorithm 16.22 is quite similar to the LLL factorization algorithm that was verified
in the previous section. Its main difference is that it has an inner loop where each inner loop
iteration has one invocation of the LLL basis reduction algorithm. Algorithm 16.22 of the textbook
is therefore closer to the factorization algorithm as it is described by Lenstra, Lenstra, and
Lov{\'a}sz \cite{LLL}, which also uses an inner loop.

The advantage of the inner loop is that it can find factors earlier, 
and then small lattices suffice where without the inner loop one
invokes the basis reduction algorithm on a large lattice. The disadvantage of the inner loop
is that if the input is irreducible, then one cannot find any factor early, so that all but the
last iteration have been useless: only the last iteration will prove irreducibility.\<close>

text \<open>This is the critical inner loop.

  In the textbook there is a bug, namely that the filter
  is applied to $g'$ and not to the primitive part of $g'$. (Problems occur if the content
  of $g'$ is divisible by $p$.) We have fixed this problem in the obvious way.

  However, there also is a second problem,
  namely it is only guaranteed that $g'$ is divisible by $u$ modulo $p^l$. However, for soundness
  we need to know that then also the primitive part of $g'$ is divisible by $u$ modulo $p^l$. 
  This is not necessary true, e.g., if $g' = p^l$, then the primitive part is $1$ which is not
  divisible by $u$ modulo $p^l$. 
  It is open, whether such a large $g'$ can actually occur. Therefore, the current fix
  is to manually test whether the leading coefficient of $g'$ is strictly smaller than $p^l$.

  With these two modifications, Algorithm 16.22 will become sound as proven below.\<close>
