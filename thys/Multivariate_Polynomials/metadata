abstract = 
  This formalization is concerned with multivariate polynomials over
  various coefficient structures (semirings, rings, fields). The
  polynomials are represented both abstractly, as coefficient functions
  with finite support, and concretely as association lists (thus
  allowing to perform actual computations).  All ring-theoretic
  operations on polynomials, such as addition and multiplication, are
  defined and shown to satisfy the usual properties. Moreover, for
  polynomials whose corresponding type of power-products is ordered by a
  linear (term) ordering, various additional notions, such as leading
  power-product, leading coefficient etc., are introduced as well.
