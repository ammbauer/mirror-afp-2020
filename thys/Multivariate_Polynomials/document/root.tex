\title{Abstract Multivariate Polynomials}
\author{Fabian Immler and Alexander Maletzky\thanks{Supported by the Austrian 
Science Fund (FWF): grant no. W1214-N15, project DK1}}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This formalization is concerned with multivariate polynomials over various 
coefficient structures (semirings, rings, fields). The polynomials are 
represented both abstractly, as coefficient functions with finite support, and 
concretely as association lists (thus allowing to perform actual computations).

All ring-theoretic operations on polynomials, such as addition and 
multiplication, are defined and shown to satisfy the usual properties. Moreover, 
for polynomials whose corresponding type of power-products is ordered by a 
linear (term) ordering, various additional notions, such as leading 
power-product, leading coefficient etc., are introduced as well.
