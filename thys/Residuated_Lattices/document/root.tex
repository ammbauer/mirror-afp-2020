\title{Residuated Lattices}
\author{Victor B. F. Gomes \and Georg Struth \\

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The theory of residuated lattices, first proposed by Ward and Dilworth~\cite{Ward39},
  is formalised in Isabelle/HOL.
  This includes concepts of residuated functions; their adjoints and conjugates.
  It also contains necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these operations
  in an arbitrary lattice.
  The mathematical components for residuated lattices are linked to the AFP entry for relation algebra.
  In particular, we prove J{\'o}nsson and Tsinakis~\cite{Jonsson93} conditions for a residuated
  boolean algebra to form a relation algebra.
